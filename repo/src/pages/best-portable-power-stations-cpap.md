### Why your CPAP needs a specialized power station

CPAP devices use sensitive electronics that don’t tolerate fluctuations or “dirty” electricity. **Pure sine wave output**—the smooth AC waveform found in household outlets—is essential. Budget power stations that deliver modified sine waves can cause humming, overheating or premature wear on medical devices【425820260943374†L284-L324】. A CPAP battery must also provide **enough capacity** to run the machine for an entire night (often 8 hours or more) and power optional heated humidifiers or heated hoses. Many machines draw 30–80 watts continuously, so a power station needs a sizeable battery to avoid running flat in the middle of the night. Other considerations include:

- **Pass‑through/UPS capability:** Some power stations can remain plugged into the wall while providing backup power to your CPAP when the grid fails. This feature eliminates the need to manually switch cords during an outage. Look for UPS switchover times under 20 milliseconds【776076420251700†L579-L583】.
- **Portability and weight:** Travellers may prioritise small, lightweight units that fit into carry‑on luggage, while home users might prefer high‑capacity models. Outbound Power’s buyer guide categorizes portable power stations as **ultra‑light (< 15 lbs)**, **lightweight (15–30 lbs)** and **large (30+ lbs)**【425820260943374†L311-L325】.
- **Charging options:** Reliable power means the ability to recharge anywhere—via wall outlet, solar panels, car charger or even a lead‑acid battery. Multiple inputs and fast charging reduce downtime.
- **Monitoring:** A clear display with battery percentage, runtime estimates and input/output wattages helps you avoid surprises. Some units integrate mobile apps via Bluetooth or Wi‑Fi【425820260943374†L329-L350】.

### Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**How long will a portable power station run my CPAP?**  Runtime depends on your CPAP’s wattage and the station’s battery capacity. Divide the battery watt‑hours (Wh) by your CPAP’s watt consumption (e.g., 504 Wh ÷ 40 W ≈ 12.6 hours). Turn off the humidifier to extend runtime. 

**What is pure sine wave and why is it important?**  Pure sine wave inverters replicate household AC power. This clean signal prevents humming, overheating or damage to sensitive CPAP machines【425820260943374†L284-L324】. Avoid modified sine wave units for medical devices.  

**Can I fly with a CPAP power station?**  The FAA generally allows lithium batteries up to 100 Wh in carry‑on luggage (with airline approval up to 160 Wh). Most CPAP‑friendly units exceed this, so they must go in checked luggage or be shipped separately. Always confirm with your airline.  

**Do I need a dedicated CPAP battery or can I use my power station for other devices?**  All the models reviewed here can power multiple devices simultaneously. However, using high‑draw appliances will reduce the runtime available for your CPAP.  

**Should I leave my power station plugged in all the time?**  For models with UPS/pass‑through capability, leaving the power station plugged in can provide seamless backup. For other units, regular charging to 80 % and storage in a cool environment will maximize battery life.
